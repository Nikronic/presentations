- The worst bit for me is being in the UK there is no way to watch a load of the exclusives, like i am sitting here, with money, trying to watch the expanse ,happy to pay any amount, but nope gotta pirate.
	- It's not on amazon prime in the UK?
		- Not until 6 months after release for the rest of the world sadly.

- Words cannot describe the frustration I feel when I want to watch a specific movie but it’s not available through any of the streaming clients I currently pay for. Netflix doesn’t have it how about Hulu? Nope, not on Hulu but what about Amazon? Amazon wants an additional $5.99 to watch it! Fuck. That.

> exclusives: you cannot access the same content on all services. each has their own and you cannot just own them in any sort
> more on this with DRM and DMCA laws

- Yeah. They don't seem to understand that piracy isn't driven by greed. It's driven by convenience. I'm happy to pay a reasonable price for a service. Maybe even two. But I'm not going to pay $12 every month to 8 different services to watch a dozen shows.

- The fact that Hulu has the audacity to stick 4, 80 second ads in a 25 minute show makes me irrationally mad.
	- The craziest thing is how paying didn't get rid of the ads.
	
> you got to pay even more for premium to get ad-free access to the content you already paid the standard price.
