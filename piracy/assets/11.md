> lets start by an example:
I published a paper, all paid by the tax money of Germany and some of my own money (I was in Iran while resources of Max Planck Institute was being used)

When I wanted to publish this, I had 3 options:
1. have no rights, not me not the public, no one: free -> ...
2. Have "some" rights to my own publication, but behind the paywall: free > $15 for each access (even myself)
3. Have "some" rights to my own publication + free access for the public: $400

We secured $400 after a while and converted our publication into a open access license so people can use it for free.

Note that we spend about $5000 (just me; never got paid though!) and another $3000 on hardware resources
and I could not access my own publication if I didn't pay another $400 to the publishing company (ACM).
