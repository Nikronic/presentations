Seriously.

I launched my first Steam game (info if you stalk my profile), and Steam will only release my profits I've made if it's over a certain amount of money.

So if I don't make 100 dollars every payment period, I don't get anything.

I made a pretty amateur game, and haven't hit the 100 dollar mark in 2 months. That means they can just keep 99 dollars of my money forever, until it hits the 100 dollar payment threshold.

I would seriously rather a dozen people pirate my game, enjoy it, spread the word, and follow my game development work.

Yeah, please, pirate my shit. It just helps me get found by more people. Hell, maybe my games suck balls, but at least that's dozens, if not hundreds of more eyes on my work that wouldn't have seen it otherwise.

Edit: This is a very wholesome thread. Thank you so much.
