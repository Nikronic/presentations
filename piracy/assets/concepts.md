concepts (mostly images, describe while image is showing):
1. client-server: only image
2. peer-to-peer (torrenting): only image
3. DMCA: first show the promise (helping creators). Then show the big hypocrisy (saving share holders of publishing companies)
4. jack sparrow vs somalian pirate (only image)
5. front vs content: 
	- download epub and pdf, use Calibre as the library front
	- create local server (NewPipe for youtube) and then Kodi as the home theater
	- note: since people have done this before, there are many easy ways of doing it (no technical knowledge is required)
