practical solutions:

## Sci-Hub
Talk about Sci-Hub website itself.

## Anna's archive

Libgen contained (almost) all books in the world. FBI got the hero behind it. and they seized it all.

Now Anna's archive is carrying Libgen's legacy.

## YouTube
1. NewPipe (Mobile and PC): privacy, download, no ad, etc
2. Youtube Revanced (Mobile): privacy, no ad, premium features (e.g., play video while phone is locked), official release (original APK)
3. Return youtube dislike: like/dislike ratio is a very good metric of the quality of the video. Youtube removed it in official app to prevent downfall of shitty content creators that promoted "purposed" content (hating police, leading to defunding police in california and skyrocketting crime rate; BLM). See the youtube's own channel.

Note: you can use **Revanced Manager** to patch almost all other apps to fix many issues such as invasive ads and so on.

## Media
Based on torrents (mostly): explain: 1) what torrent is (not illegal intrinsicly) 2) benefits: peer to peer (no blocking), people for people 3) downside: bad people (those who buy property when there is blood on streets)

1. TorrentGalaxy
	- latest musics, movies, games, software, documentaries, , tv series, all in verity of qualities from *official* uploaders
	- other data such as books, shows (e.g., Jimmy "dumbass" Fallon/Kimmel), porn(open access means everything obviously, either all or none), etc.
	- alternatives: eztv, torrentdownload, 1337, etc. (check r/piracy megathread)
2. fmovies:
	- watch streaming services content (non-music) all in high quality, live, for free
	- alternative: netmovies

Question: How come FBI or other authorties are not taking these sites down?
1. jurisdiction: obvious one; US cannot do anything about Iran (and many other countries)
2. jurisdiction: hard one; auditing logs of individuals on what they own is not legal (many exceptions, I don't know law)
2. DMCA: digital millennium copyright act; only applies if you share or host the copyrighted content
	- These sites all are index (like a phonebook), they host nothing. individuals host stuff e.g., me!
3. don't care

Bonus: ThePirateBay, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR_v5xl4Jnw
Summary: all those greedy compyright holders prosecuted the founders, got them all one by one, but the content never died even though police destroyed all the servers! People for the People.

## Twitch
1. PurpleTV (Mobile): no ad (twitch and content creator)

Everything Else:
 - r/piracy megathread
 - reddit
 - 4chan
